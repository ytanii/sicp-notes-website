- In [Chapter 1](../1/) we wrote procedures that operated on simple numerical data.
- In this chapter we are going to look at more complex data.

> Just as the ability to define procedures enables us to deal with processes at a higher conceptual level than that of the primitive operations of the language, the ability to construct compound data objects enables us to deal with data at a higher conceptual level than that of the primitive data objects of the language.

- Consider functions dealing with rational numbers: only being able to return one number is awkward. This is where compound data objects become useful.
- *Data abstraction* separates representation from use. It enables us to construct *abstraction barriers* between different parts of the program.
