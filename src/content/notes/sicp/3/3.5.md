- We’ve used assignment as a powerful tool and dealt with some of the complex problems it raises.
- Now we will consider another approach to modeling state, using data structures called *streams*.
- We want to avoid identifying time in the computer with time in the modeled world.
- If $x$ is a function of time $x(t)$, we can think of the identify $x$ as a history of values (and these don’t change).
- With time measured in discrete steps, we can model a time function as a sequence of values.
- Stream processing allows us to model state without assignments.
